## Overview
This repository contains the Python code for a natural language processing (NLP) based framework developed as part of my thesis project. The code employs the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to detect instances of greenwashing using news articles, by giving them a "greenwashing score". The project aims to enhance the clarity and accountability of corporate sustainability reporting by leveraging advanced AI techniques.

## Features
- BERT Implementation: Utilizes a pre-trained BERT model to analyze textual data and understand the context of greenwashing claims.
- Custom Definitions: Incorporates tailored definitions of greenwashing developed from extensive literature reviews to capture nuanced expressions in corporate communications.
